## Hyperledger Fabric-CA Client for Node.js

SDK for writing node.js applications to interact with [Hyperledger Fabric CA](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Setup/ca-setup.html).

This package encapsulates the APIs to interact with the Fabric CA to manage user certificates lifecycle such as register, enroll, renew and revoke. 

A separate package is provided, `fabric-client`, to interact with Peers and Orderers to install and instantiate chaincodes, send transactions and perform queries.
